/**
 * A very simple implementation of {@link com.davemorrissey.labs.subscaleview.decoder.ImageRegionDecoder}
 * using the RapidDecoder library (https://github.com/suckgamony/RapidDecoder). For PNGs, this can
 * give more reliable decoding and better performance. For JPGs, it is slower and can run out of
 * memory with large images, but has better support for grayscale and CMYK images.
 *
 * This is an incomplete and untested implementation provided as an example only.
